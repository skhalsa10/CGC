## Introduction
This project similates possible behavior of the CGC. The CGC is a system
that would help control the entire software application for a park that has a T-Rex 
exhibit. it will handle sales and tracking of devices as well as communication.
It this where to be implemented in a real life scenario we would be using sockets 
communication between all different parts. in an effort to simulate this without having to run
multiple applications at once we isolated everything to run from one application.

## Contributions
This is a group project that is an extension of the hard design work performed
in the documents, TFS, RDD, SRS, SAD. All 5 team members have contributed

## Usage

It is very easy to use this application.
- Entry Point: Main Class
- JDK Version: 10
- must use JRE 10

#### Starting the App
1. please Make sure you are using the JRE 10 to run this application
2. Please Download the folder CGCExecutableJAR it contains everything needed to run the application
3. Open up a terminal or command prompt and cd into the downloaded folder
4. Type `java -jar Implementation.jar`

##### When you download the jar make sure you download the jar from the master branch on csgit


#### GUI
The GUI is really simple. The application is a true simulation in the sense that it pretty much runs on it's own.
there is one thing that can be controlled and this is the Emergency Mode state. this can be toggled
using the buttons on the left side of the GUI. The buttons on the right toggle a health overlay. and will take you to a page describing the 
tokens that have been purchased


## Versions 

right now there is currently only 1 version.

## Docs

the documents used to build this application can be found outside of the Implementation folder.
