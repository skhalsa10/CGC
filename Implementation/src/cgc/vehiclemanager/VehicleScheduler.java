/**
 * This is another class that I am not sure exactly how it will be implemented.
 * It almost seems similar enough to the dispatcher that it could have the behavior merged into one class
 *
 *  NOTE: if you decide to make this class extends Thread you should do the following:
 *      1. add a PriorityBlockingQueue<Message>
 *      2. make sure to implement the Interface Communicator
 *      3. And pass in a reference to the VehicleManager inside the Constructor
 *
 *      Not implemented
