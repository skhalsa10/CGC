Here is a brainstorm of interfaces we may need to worry about:

pay Kiosks
    - Credit card 
    - Touch Screen User interface
    - Token builder
    - Maintenance status
    - Cash recepticle
    - change dispenser
    - ethernet connection

Token
    -GPS 
    -RFID 
    -Does the token have a speaker (for alarms and communications?
    -Does the tracker have a digital screen for map and instructions?
    -Wireless networking 

Car (API that interfaces the following to the CGC)
    - Alarm (loud external speaker)
    - RFID reader that covers the proximity of the car.
    - seat weight sensor?
    - camera feed
    - Intercom communication 
    - Door Locks
    - maintenance system status
    - Wireless networking

Camera network (API that provides the following)
    - interface with monitoring system to view any camera
    - interface with system to control specified camera
    - interface with DVR system
    - maintenance system status
    - Hardwire Ethernet (redundent uplinks)

Electric Fence
    - active status
    - Maintenance status
    - Electrical input status
    - Hardwire Ethernet (redundent uplinks)

Global Alarm system
    - Speaker access
    - Maintenance status
    - Hardwire Ethernet (redundent uplinks)

CGC Station (to monitor system and respond to nodes)
    - speaker
    - microphone
    - monitor
    - touch screen recognition
    - Hardwire Ethernet (redundent uplinks)

GPS server (provides locations of all relative nodes)
    - keeps track of all GPS devices and their longitude and latitude
    - third party service to privide GPS services
     
Island Infrastructure
    - Wireless network infrastructure for communication of all networked devices
    - hard wire Ethernet network infrastructure for a fast LAN 
    - Power and backup generator
