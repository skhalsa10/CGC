\section{Introduction} %Zeke
\paragraph{} \textit{//introduction}

\section{Objectives} 
\label{obj}
\paragraph{} \textit{Four objectives believed to be critical for an 
optimal implementation of a \textit{Cretaceous Gardens Controller} are identified here 
\footnote{Objectives by Anas and Siri.}.}
 
	\subsection{Safety}\label{saf}
	\paragraph{}The main objective of the CGC is to provide a safe and reliable 
	experience for the client and the end users. Whether it be electric fences 
	or autonomous vehicles, ensuring safety is of highest priority. The end user
	ought to feel completely safe as should the client whose liability depends on
	this aspect.

	\subsection{User Experience}\label{use}
	\paragraph{} In order to fully realize an amazing experience for the end user,
	the CGC must facilitate token purchases and foster intuitive and seamless interactions
	with the vehicles. 

	\subsection{Maintainability}\label{mai}
	\paragraph{} For the sake of maintainability, the state the CGC should be easily
	accessible and it should be understandable. All nodes should inherit this feature. 
	The system should also be maintainable in real-time, so it should be prepared for
	any redundancies that support this aim.
	
	\subsection{Efficiency}\label{eff}
	\paragraph{}When it comes to efficiency, the CGC will make sure that both 
	the software and hardware components are highly efficient and functional. 
	Whether we talk about self-driving cars, pay kiosks, camera system, GPS, 
	or electric fences, the CGC must be efficient in interacting with them. 
	This will be possible when all the other objectives are met.  



\section{Overall System Organization} 
\label{sys}
\paragraph{} The CGC will be centralized\footnote{System Organization 
by Anas and Siri.} and will manage all relevant components. Figure 
\ref{fig:blackbox} shows a black box diagram of the CGC. The CGC receives inputs 
from sensors, user interfaces, and emergency systems like the \textit{Global 
Alarm System} and responds through appropriate output actions as described 
below.

% the outline for a solution
	\subsection{Emergency Capabilities}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Alarm – distinct and able to hear everywhere.

		\item Surplus of Cars – extra cars will be stored up both the north and south side of the island so as to ensure full evacuation.
		\item Car Dispatching – in the case of emergency all south side cars without passengers will be dispatched north in order to gather all guests as quickly as possible.
	\end{enumerate}
