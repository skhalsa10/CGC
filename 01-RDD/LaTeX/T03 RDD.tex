\section{Objectives} 
\label{obj}
\paragraph{} \textit{We came up with four main objectives that we believe are critical to this specific system. We believe if we design the software around these objectives that it will produce the best  and most appropriate product.}
\subsection{Safety}\label{saf}
\paragraph{}The main objective of this product is to build a CGCS which focuses on safe and reliable experience to our customers. Whether we talk about the electric fences or self-driving cars, ensuring safety is the highest priority. We want the visitors to feel safe in every way possible and therefore, all these necessary measurements are taken into account by the CGCS.
\subsection{User Experience}\label{use}
\paragraph{}We want the user to have an amazing experience. Since this is a park to witness the amazing T-Rex, the user experience should be top notch. We will achieve this by focusing on the details of every interaction with the user. This involves easy token purchases and intuitive interaction with the vehicles. The user experience must be reliable. 
\subsection{Maintainability}\label{mai}
\paragraph{}The entire CGCS and all nodes that it controls will be designed with maintainability in mind. The system will understand the state of its health and report on it. Every node of the system will be designed this way and the CGCS will understand the health state of all systems. The system will have redundant infrastructure to maintain the system with minimal downtime specifically focus on the electric fence.
\subsection{Efficiency}\label{eff}
\paragraph{}When it comes to efficiency, the CGCS will make sure that both the software and hardware components are highly efficient and functional. Whether we talk about self-driving cars, pay kiosks, camera system, gps, or electric fences, the CGCS must be efficient in interacting with them. This will be possible when all the other objectives are met.

			\end{list}





\subsection{System Interfaces}
\paragraph{} \textit{System Interfaces provide all the sensors that are related to safety. The main purpose of these interfaces is to ensure that the ECS properly operates and safely carries its passengers to their respective destinations.}
\subsubsection{Alignment Sensor Interface}
\paragraph{} The alignment sensor interface will ensure that each elevator cabin is properly aligned to the floor before the elevator cabin can open its doors. This interface will concurrently work with the door sensor interface. Once the floor is detected, this interface will send its signal to the door sensor to open the doors. This will ensure that the passengers get to their destination safely without getting injured.
\subsubsection{Door Sensor Interface}
\paragraph{}To further talk about safety measures, the door sensor interface is required, which will help protect our clients from any mishap. This interface will provide specifications for handling the mechanism of opening and closing the doors. In the case of any obstruction, this interface’s specification will also prompt the door to open immediately and wait a fixed amount of time until the danger is clear.
\subsubsection{Fire Alarm Sensor Interface}
\paragraph{} In order to ensure safety, one very important interface is the fire alarm sensor. The fire alarm sensors are wired throughout the hotel. There will be fire alarm sensing in the ECS which will prevent both elevator cars and elevator bays from functioning if the fire alarm is activated. This state will be valid until the Emergency key is detected.
\subsubsection{Keyhole Panel Interface}
\paragraph{} The keyhole panel interface will provide functionality to specific clients such as Executives and Firefighters. The 20th floor button will have a special status and it will only work if an executive key is detected. This interface will be very simple and straight-forward to use for our special clients as it will only require a key to unlock more features in the elevator.
\subsubsection{Speed and Acceleration Sensor Interface}
\paragraph{} The speed and acceleration sensor interface will be responsible for following the state’s regulations and protocols. This interface will help in ensuring that the elevator cabins in the ECS do not go over the minimum and maximum speed.  This interface will also provide the specifications for acceleration sensing which will be relatively based on the weight each elevator cabin carries.

\subsubsection{Weight Sensor Interface}
\paragraph{} Each elevator cabin in the ECS will be equipped with weight sensors to ensure safety. This interface will provide specifications for the safety requirements as well as being responsible for letting the clients know whenever some specific elevator cabin has reached the weight limit. (Note: each elevator cabin has its own weight capacity limit, therefore, if one elevator cabin has reached the weight limit, this will not affect other elevator cabins).


\subsection{User Interfaces}
\paragraph{} \textit{User Interfaces provide all the necessary options that the passengers need.
They are meant to be simple, straight forward and easy to use.}
\subsubsection{Button Panel Interface}
\paragraph{} When it comes to assisting the passengers inside the elevator cabin, an important interface is the button panel interface. This button panel interface will provide all 20 different floor buttons as well as closing the door and opening the door buttons.
\subsubsection{Keyhole Panel Interface}
\paragraph{} The keyhole panel interface will provide functionality to specific clients such as Executives and Firefighters. The 20th floor button will have a special status and it will only work if an executive key is detected. This interface will be very simple and straight-forward to use for our special clients as it will only require a key to unlock more features in the elevator.


% \section{Capabilities} %Zeke
% \label{cap}
% \textit{Herein is the outline of what the Elevator Control System will be capable and of what it will not be capable. Most of its capabilities may be described in terms of various protocols and its limitations may be described relative to the capabilities of external hardware that is to provide it data. For example, the \textit{ECS} should be expected to move cabins from floor to floor at safe speeds and accelerations but it cannot possibly account for speedometers and accelerometers that provide it inaccurate data. Sensors are assumed to not be faulty, as they are not part of the \textit{ECS} but are to provide it information.}
% % the outline for a solution
% \subsection{Capacity Protocol} The \textit{ECS}, under the assumption that all weight capacity sensors in the cabins are fully functional, may be expected to never provide service to a cabin whose weight capacity has been reached or exceeded. The cabin is to
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Alert passengers of overcapacity issue.
% \item Notify passengers that it will not provide service until the issue has been resolved.
% \item Remain on the floor until the issue has been resolved.
% \item Continue regular functions after the issue has been resolved.
% \end{enumerate}

% \subsection{Emergency Protocol} The \textit{ECS}, under the assumption that the alarm system is fully functional, may be expected follow the correct protocol when presented with an emergency situation.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Close all doors (provided there are no obstructions).
% \item Move all cabins to the lobby floor without stopping at any floors between its initial floor and the lobby.
% \item Open all doors after having arrived to the lobby.
% \item Remain open until an emergency key is detected in the emergency keyhole.
% \end{enumerate}

% \subsection{Efficient Usage Protocol} The \textbf{ECS} may be expected to optimize resource usage in the following ways.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Any requests from floors between an elevator's \textit{current floor} and its most recent \textit{target floor} will be fulfilled so as to not waste time and energy by addressing requests in the order they were received.
% \item \label{mor} If more than one request is detected at the same time and the elevator is \textit{empty}, the \textit{ECS} will dispatch whichever elevator is closest to either \textit{target floor}.
% \item \label{eql} In the event that multiple requests are made simultaneously, that the elevator is \textit{empty} and that no \textit{target floor} is closer than another, the \textit{ECS} will arbitrarily break any ties by randomly choosing which elevator to dispatch to the floors.
% \item Any \textit{non-empty} elevators found to be in either situation \ref{mor} or \ref{eql} will ignore requests from floors located opposite of its direction.
% \item If a cabin is currently \textit{empty}, then the cabin will be allowed to travel at greater accelerations and speeds than when it is \textit{non-empty}.
% \end{enumerate}

% \subsection{Executive Usage Protocol} The \textit{ECS}, under the assumption that all \textit{executive keyholes} and \textit{executive keys} function properly, may be expected to only permit access to the penthouse when the correct key is inserted and detected in the correct keyhole by the ECS. The penthouse is also known as the topmost floor, floor 20, 20th floor, or executive suite.

% \subsection{Obstruction Protocol} The \textit{ECS}, under the assumption that all \textit{obstruction sensors} function properly, within all cabins and all bays, may be expected to never close any cabin doors nor any bay doors that find themselves obstructed. In the event that an obstruction is found, the \textit{ECS} shall
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Stop all door motion in the associated cabin(s) and bays(s).
% \item Slowly decelerate the associated cabin(s) to a halt if in motion upon detection.
% \item Slowly open both sets of doors (away from the center of the cabin and bay openings).
% \item Remain open until the obstruction has been cleared.
% \item Continue regular service.
% \end{enumerate}
