(Italics)The maintenance of this system is an extremely important aspect of this syste. It is critical 
that every device that communicates on this system stay maintained and in peek performance at all time. Well maintained
equipment will fail less. Due to the intense need for safety we can not cut corners for the CGC and need for 
a system that identifies the need for maintenance efficiently is critical. This project can be technically feasible identifieswe make this a focal point.
the maintenance system will monitor and respond to the cars, electric fence, the camera network, the kiosks and tokens.

Cars

The autonomous vehicle is a unique piece of equipment. It is fully aware of the sensors and parts that it controls.
We will leave it up to the company that we contract out to build cars that can identify when they need maintenance.
We will work with the vehicle manufacturers to make sure the cars follow specific maintenance protocals. We will bbuild protocols that
address how a car behaves if it needs maintenance while with passengers out on the islandbut can still drive, or 
if it is more serious and the car can not drive.
