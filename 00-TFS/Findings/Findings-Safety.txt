In terms of safety findings for the Cretaceous Gardens Control System (CGCS, the Electric Fence status needs to be available for customers safety. When the
electric fence fails, the Emergency mode must be activated to ensure customers safety. When it comes to self-driving cars, they will also have some safety
features. These safety features are: making sure the door locks securely before it begins to drive. The self-driving cars should know what visitors they are
carrying to the T-Rex pit by scanning their tokens first, and then letting the visitors in. One more important safety check is that the self-driving cars
should only leave once all the assigned visitors are in the car. Once, the visitors alotted time finishes, the self-driving notifies them and bring them
back to the south-end. Last but not least, there will be dedicated patrol cars used by employees to go back and forth from south to north end and making 
sure that everything is safe.
