When it comes to emergency for the CGCS, the CGCS will go in Emergency Mode when either the electric fence goes off or whenever the maintenance personnel 
tests the system and the alarm goes off. In the case of emergency, the alarms will be triggered everywhere. In the case of an emergency, there will be X
amount of self-driving cars always be located at the north-side. The self-driving cars will not follow any protocol in the case of an emergency and will 
accept any passengers and carry the passengers without the requirement of whether the vehicle has all the passengers or not. All the cars on the south end 
who are not driving any passengers will be relocated to north end to ensure that all the visitors are safely carried back to south end without any 
major damage. Note here that during the emergency mode, if the fence comes back up, the emergency mode will not exit until manually triggered by a
human employee.
