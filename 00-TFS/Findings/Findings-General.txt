1st Paragraph!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The general findings for this system are somewhat straight-forward. In order to be feasible, this system needs a working camera network.
This Cretaceous Gardens Control System (CGCS) will manage all the cameras. There will also be self paying kiosk which will present tokens/tickets
that are unique to each customer. These unique ID will act as a key and a locator(GPS) for each user. The kiosk's main functionality will be to give tickets to the user, accept credit/debit card or cash as the 
payment option from the user. In addition to that, it is also feasible that the user should fill out the form with their names, emergency
contact and a waiver so that the CGCS can easily manage people's records.
