Given Constraints
 - Visitors arrive by port on south side of the island
 - Automatic payment kiosk - provides a unique token/ticket
 - The token will grant Vehicle access
 - The token will provide Viewing access
 - Self-Driving car will stop at the south-end and can drive at most 10 people(could be less)
 - car will lock securely and drive passangers to north-end
 - all cars position will be accounted for at all times
 - Massive enclosure with electric fence will enclose T-rex
 - There will be at LEAST one video camera
 - the vehicle doors will unlock at the T-rex exhibit
 - after allotted time vehicle will sound alarm to tell visitor it is time to leave
 - The vehicle will NOT leave untill all guests are back on the vehicle
 - doors lock securely and vehicle returns to south-end
 - Emergency protocol exists very strict for when the electric fence fails
    - Alarm will sound at north and south end
    - the system must act quickly to get all visitors to the south-end of the island


The following ideas are what I believe are needing to make this project technically feasable:


Findings
    - General
        - We will need a working camera network. all cameras should be viewable from control system
        - the self paying kiosk will present tokens(tickets) that are unique 
            - form must be filled out with name, emergency contact, and waiver
            - accept credit card
            - accept cash
            - upon acceptance the token with unique ID will be tied to 
            must be able to configure the token and revuild RFID information
        - (my opinion) I believe that these tokens should be devices that have:
            - map (digital?) used to help guide
            - ***NEEDED*** GPS - will be tracked
            - ***NEEDED*** reprogrammable RFID ship
            - Speaker - to help instruct 
        - Self-Driving car (contracted out) (how many total cars do we have?)
            - must work with out interface and logic for use in normal mode
            - must work with out interface and logic for use in Emergency mode
            - must include GPS
            - must include loud Speaker
            - must include a unique car ID
            - Must include an RFID reader
            - there must be a call button to talk with the Control Station
            - door sensors
    - Safety
        - Electric Fence status needs to be available.
        - When Electric fence fails emergency mode MUST be activated
        - Cars will have a safety features
            - they will lock securely when driving,
            - they must know what visitors they drive over to T-Rex pit (using the tokens)
            - they sound an alarm and send notifications to tokens that they are keeping track of after alloted time to bring back to south-end
            - They will ONLY leave after all visitors that it drove over are inside the car
            - there will be X amount of dedicated patrol cars used by employees that go back and forth from south to north end

    - Emergency
        - Emergency Mode triggered from the electric fence outage or from testing in maintanance mode
        - Alarms triggered everywhere!
        - There will be X amount of self driving cars that will always be located at the north-side only used for emergency mode
        - Cars will loosen the requirements and will begin accepting  any passengers and will begin leaving every X minutes whether full or not
        - all cars that are NOT currently in manual override or driving passengers back to the south end will be dispatched to the north-end
        - after emergency mode is initiated - even if the fence comes back up, emergency mode should not exit until manually triggered by a human employee
    - Maintanance
        - Cars 
            - will need to alert the Control station when they need maintanance if it can drive they should return to the south lot and taken out of production
            - any passengers that were on this vehicle can board a new vehicle
            - if a car breaks down on the island a maintanance crew will ride a new self-driving vehicle to the broken down one and help move visiters into new vehicle.
            
        - Fence
            - the power to the fence should have extra redundencies which allows for seemless maintanance with absolutely NO power outage
        - camera systems
            - camera should be hot swapable and uplinks should be redundent
        - tokens 
            - these may need to be maintaned and upgraded and replaced over time.
        - kiosks
            - these should notify the control station of need for maintanance or have a manual override to turn on maintanance mode
