\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{} With new technological advancements come new opportunities and new risks. It 
 is important for any entrepreneur to be able to conservatively calculate potential benefits, and 
 to liberally estimate potential liabilities. With that in mind, Cretaceous Gardens (CG) ought to 
 expect a system that delivers efficient service while minimizing the accumulation of loss and liability. 
 It is understood that CG has in its hands the torch of bioengineering achievement, therefore the
 feasibility of a controller (CGC) necessarily impacts the position of CG at the top of the field.
 No great feat comes without risk, therefore an ideal controller shall prioritize the safety of
 visitors to the island. Only after such a guarantee can be established, should the system then
 prioritize efficiency and profitability. Without an impeccably safe system, a long-term influx 
 of customers is unlikely and without that, there are simply no worthwhile profits to be collected.
 
\paragraph{} The island is understood to be overlaid with a vast network of agents and equipment to
ensure the reliable connectedness of the resort. All nodes (whether it be the autonomous vehicles that are
to transport precious visitors to and from the main attraction, the electric fence enclosure that will 
house the mighty \textit{Tyrannosaurus Rex}, the system of security cameras, the reliable maintenance crew, 
or the kiosks that are to dispense every single accounted-for token) will ultimately be under the wings
of the ideal controller. Considerations should be made early with regard to broad organization of the system
(i.e. centralized, with plenty of redundancy or a distributed in order to avoid a single point of failure?).
Below is an outline of such considerations, some given by Cretaceous Gardens, and many others provided by
the developers of the system.


\section{Logistic Implications}
\paragraph{} \textit{section introduction}

	\subsection{Given Constraints}
	\paragraph{} Constraints provided by CG are presented as a foundation on which to build. It should be 
	noted that it is not necessarily complete, as more may be provided in the near future. It is as likely 
	that some may be deemed unnecessary if another constraint is found to subsume them. Questions pertaining 
	to a given constraint are shown parenthetically.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Visitors will arrive by port on the \textit{south side} of the island.
		\\(At what rate?)
		\item The main attraction will be located on the north side of the island. 
		\\(Are there multiple routes?)
		\item The main attraction will be a \textit{Tyrannosaurus Rex} within a massive electric fence enclosure. 
		\\(Can it be monitored on a per-panel basis?)
		\item An automatic payment kiosk will provide a unique token \textit{or} ticket to each visitor. 
		\\(What if the item is damaged or lost?)
		\item The token \textit{or} ticket will grant vehicle access \textit{and} exhibit viewing access.
		\item Self-driving car(s) are to stop at the \textit{south end} in order to drive \textit{at most} 10 people. 
		\\(How many cars at a time?)
		\item All cars are to lock securely \textit{before} transporting visitors to the north-end.
		\item All cars are to unlock \textit{after} arriving at the exhibit.
		\item All cars are to alert visitors when their allotted time to be at the exhibit has run out. 
		\\(Will this alert be different than an emergency alert?)
		\\(What should happen if a visitor ignores the "time-up" alert?)
		\\(Who or what will enforce this?)
		\item The vehicle is not to leave until all visitors are inside the vehicle. 
		\\(Even during an emergency?)
		\item The positions of all cars are to be accounted for at all times. 
		\\(To what precision?)
		\item There will be \textit{at least} one video camera. 
		\\(Will it be closed circuit?) 
		\\(What kind of camera?)
		\item Doors are to lock securely with all guests inside \textbf{before} returning the \textit{south end}.
		\item There is to be a \textit{very strict} protocol in the event of an enclosure failure.
		\item The emergency alarm is to sound at both ends of the island.
		\item The system is to be responsible for the quick transport of all visitors to the south end in the event of such an emergency.
		\\(What should be done if casualties occur?)
		\\(Should an optional manual driving mode be made available to willing visitors in such an emergency?)
		\\(What should happen in the event of path obstructions?)
		\\(How resilient will the vehicles be in the local terrain?)

\section{Findings}
\paragraph{} \textit{section introduction}
	\subsection{General}
	\paragraph{} The general findings for this system are somewhat straight-forward. 
	In order to be feasible, this system needs a working camera network. This Cretaceous
	Gardens Controller (CGC) will manage all the cameras. There will also be self paying 
	kiosk which will present tokens/tickets that are unique to each customer. These unique 
	ID will act as a key and a locator(GPS) for each user. The kiosk's main functionality 
	will be to give tickets to the user, accept credit/debit card or cash as the payment 
	option from the user. In addition to that, it is also feasible that the user should 
	fill out the form with their names, emergency contact and a waiver so that the CGC 
	can easily manage people's records.

	\subsection{Maintenance}
	\paragraph{} \textit{The maintainability of this system is extremely important. 
	It is critical that every device that communicates through the system are maintained 
	and in peak performance at all times. Well maintained equipment will fail less. Due to 
	the intense need for safety we can not cut corners for the CGC and need for a system 
	that identifies the need for maintenance efficiently is critical. This project can 
	be technically feasible. The maintenance system will monitor and respond to all cars, 
	the electric fence, the camera network, the kiosks and tokens.}
	
	\paragraph{} \textit{body paragraph}

	\subsection{Cars}
	\paragraph{} The autonomous vehicle is a unique piece of equipment. It is fully 
	aware of the sensors and parts that it controls. We will leave it up to the 
	company that we contract out to build cars that can identify when they need 
	maintenance. We will work with the vehicle manufacturers to make sure the cars 
	follow specific maintenance protocals. We will bbuild protocols that address how 
	a car behaves if it needs maintenance while with passengers out on the islandbut 
	can still drive, or if it is more serious and the car can not drive.
