\section{Introduction} \label{intro}
\paragraph{} Good software is identified by the end user for its features and functionality, by the client
for its profitability and maintainability, and by the programmer for its legibility and clarity. It should be clear
that all three pillars ultimately characterize good software, but more importantly that the three are interdependent.
The developer must then guarantee all of the above for the sake of all entities involved. A top down approach has been
taken up to this point. The feasibility study asked answered the fundamental question: Can it be done? The requirements
definition document was then passed the baton and answered the next logical question: Within what parameters can it be done?
The software specification document then answered: What is the desired behavior of the system? Now we may answer: 
How will ensure the desired behavior?

\paragraph{} The ultimate goal is to ensure an efficient, safe, and maintainable implementation of the Cretaceous Gardens Controller (CGC) software\footnote{Introduction by Zeke.}. To that end, all objects are illustrated in their proper contexts, and their crucial functions have been delineated as clearly as possible while simultaneously allowing the programmer enough flexibility so as to not stifle his or her creative process. 

\paragraph{} This is a road map for the eventual implementation of the system. It details the most relevant objects and their relationships in the form of diagrams. Explanations accompany all diagrams for the sake of clarity.

\section{Design Overview} \label{over}
\paragraph{} \textit{The class architecture presented here\footnote{Diagrams by 
Siri and Anas.} aims to maximize efficiency, maintainability, and 
safety. Without an efficient system, its safety may be compromised due to unnecessary 
delays between components. Maintainability can impact a safe implementation of the 
system if the system is permeable to programmer errors. The decoupling of concerns and 
a solid hierarchy are paramount. The design has been color-coded to increase readability. 
The colors are only for the sake of distinguishing one component from another. The component 
specification diagrams in the following section inherit these colors. Small red arrows point 
to objects that may be triggered by an event. Said objects are virtual devices and iconifications 
of their physical triggers have been connected to them with bidirectional blue arrows.}

\section{Component Specifications}
\paragraph{} \textit{Here are the class specifications\footnote{Component specifications by Anas and Siri.} for objects 
found in Section \ref{over}. The most important attributes and functions are given and where appropriate, any expected 
preconditions, parameters, return values, and post conditions are included. Explanations are given for each component, but 
it should be noted that helper functions are not shown, as they are entrusted with the programmer. Important fields and helper
fields are treated analogously.}

                panel in question.
                \item The GSO observes a guest hurling rocks at the enclosure, which
                explains the voltage spikes.
                \item The GSO immediately and firmly tells the guest to stop throwing rocks
                through the PA system near the site.
                \item The GSO is ignored by the guest who gives the finger to the camera.
                \item The GSO dispatches the nearest patrol vehicle to the location.
                \item The GSO explains the situation to the security guard that happens 
                to be in the patrol vehicle at the time.

        \item[]\textbf{Primary Actor:}
            Emergency Personnel

        \item[]\textbf{Goal in Context:}
            To find any potentially remaining guests after a disaster has occurred on the island.
            
        \item[]\textbf{Preconditions:}
            Emergency mode may or may not be currently active, but it has definitely been triggered prior to 
            the arrival of the actor.

        \item[]\textbf{Trigger:}
            A distress signal has been received from Cretaceous Gardens (from Isla Trueno).

        \item[]\textbf{Scenario:}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The platoon has received orders to address an emergency on Isla Trueno. 
                \item The troops arrive to the island littered with debris and corpses. 
                \item Some Pay kiosks remain active with an eerie glow coming from an uncannily 
                cheerful welcome screen.
                \item Screams of terror can be heard in the distance, followed by tremendous roars.
                \item The Emergency Personnel head to the kiosks and enter special codes that provide
                them with an enormous supply of token devices.
                \item The EP diffuse throughout the island as they sweep for survivors.
                \item Several helicopters can be heard swarming overhead and small group

                \item The troops give the injured new tokens which may be detected by the team
                at the station.
                \item A second group arrives at the island, and is directed by the team at the station
                (via walkie talkies) to the injured.
                \item The team notices the T-Rex Monitor signal moving toward the sweeping group of soldiers
                and they alert them immediately to get into offensive positions.

    \textit{The guest is the primary benefactor of many to the system's features. The primary role of this
    actor is to safely indulge in what the resort has to offer. The most common use for a guest is to see the main
    exhibit but there may be several prerequisite uses that lead up to that.}

        \item[]\textbf{Scenario:}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Upon hearing of the grand opening of Cretaceous Gardens, the guest immediately
                heads to the island by whatever means possible.
                \item On arrival, the guest witnesses tremendous lines formed at many pay kiosks
                near the entrance of the resort.
                \item After what seems like an eternity, the it is the guest's turn to purchase entry to the resort.
                \item The guest is welcomed through a pleasant graphical display.
                \item The guest is asked a series of questions in order verify compliance with the park policies
                (e.g. How old are you? Do you consent to having your picture taken? Do you accept full responsibility 
                for any injuries sustained due to personal choices? Do you accept the risks of seeing a live 
                Tyrannosaurus Rex and free Cretaceous Gardens of any and all consequences of doing so?)
                \item After ignoring all the fine print and zipping through the legal stuff, the guest finally
                arrives at the screen that will allow the rental of an access token.
                \item The guest enters the amount of time he or she plans to stay and is given the total price.
                \item The guest is prompted to enter payment.

                \item The guest eventually arrives at a parked car, into which others may or may not be entering.
                \item The guest enters the token device into the seatbelt buckle and secures the seatbelt.
                \item The guest lets the car do its job (see section \ref{carscenarios}).
                \item The guest arrives at the exhibit and exits the car, taking the token device along.

            There exists some imminent threat to the guest (it may be an enclosure failure, inclement 
            weather, or any other emergency of similar caliber). Sudden guest death (unrelated to the
            island or system) may also be the case.

            Something horrible occurs. For simplicity, the following scenario assumes the T.Rex destroys
            its enclosure and is now on the loose.

                island wide speaker system, the Global Alarm System.
                \item Guests receive instructions via the above means with interleaved reassurances
                that extra vehicles are on the way to pick them up.
                \item Guests are also informed that they may enter any vehicle, with or without tokens.
                \item Once in the vehicle, guests are asked (via the token device) whether or not
                they would like to depart.
                \item If at least one individual submits a yes, the car transmits a message to indicate
                imminent departure with a warning that doors will soon close.
                \item Once in motion, the guest in the driver seat is offered the option to place the vehicle into
                manual mode.
                \item If the individual chooses to do so, then he or she may now pilot the vehicle as he or she wishes.
                \item Otherwise, the car will head south as quickly and as safely as possible.
                \item Once at the south end, the car will park and wait for guests to exit.
                \item After it has been confirmed that no guests remain in the vehicle (seat weight sensors
                indicate all seats are empty), the guests are given another warning to stand back.
                \item As the guests head toward the exit, the car closes its doors and speeds north 
                to collect more guests.

    \subsection{Zookeeper} \label{zook}
    \textit{A zookeeper may interact with the CGC in a variety of ways, but some of the
    major roles of such an actor (as with any zookeeper) are to prepare the diet of the T-Rex, 
    feed the T.Rex, to observe its behavior, or groom it.}

            FeedTRex                                

        \item[]\textbf{Primary Actor:}
            Zookeeper

        \item[]\textbf{Goal in Context:}
            To safely provide food for the T.Rex, whether it be live, frozen, thawed, or prepared
            prey.

        \item[]\textbf{Preconditions:}
            The CGC is not in emergency mode, and all components are fully functional.

        \item[]\textbf{Trigger:}
            It is time to feed the T.Rex.

        \item[]\textbf{Scenario:}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The CGC Station Operator dispatches the zookeeper in a self driving car
                to the edge of the enclosure furthest from the current location of the T.Rex.
                \item The Zookeeper requests an all-clear confirmation from the operator.
                \item The operator disengages the electricity of the panel to provide access.
                \item The Zookeeper enters and travels a significant distance into the enclosure.
                \item The Zookeeper drops off the food.
                \item The Zookeeper travels back the point of entry.
                \item The Zookeeper exits the enclosure.
                \item The Operator confirms successful exit.
                \item The Operator reengages the electricity of the panel. 
            \end{enumerate}

        \item[]\textbf{Exceptions:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[] There is a shortage of food on the island.
                \item[] The T.Rex is sick or injured and does not want to eat.
                \item[] The T.Rex reaches the zookeeper before the zookeeper exits the enclosure.
            \end{itemize}

        \item[]\textbf{Priority:}
            Essential, must be implemented

        \item[]\textbf{When Available:}
            On demand and via operator-zookeeper protocol

        \item[]\textbf{Frequency of Use:}
            Periodically (it can be daily, weekly, or monthly for example)

        \item[]\textbf{Channel to Primary Actor:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[] Enclosure Panel
            \end{itemize}

        \item[]\textbf{Secondary Actors:}
            CGC Station Operator, T.Rex, Car
        
        \item[]\textbf{Channels to Secondary Actors:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[] CGC Station Operator: Car Intercom, Camera Network
                \item[] T.Rex: Enclosure Panel
            \end{itemize}

        \item[]\textbf{Open Issues:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[] Should the panel remain inactive while 
                the zookeeper is inside?
                \item[] Should the zookeeper simply wear an electric 
                safety suit to avoid disengagement all together?

\section{Design Constraints} \label{cons}
\paragraph{} \textit{Due to the real-time nature of the system, there exist some additional 
constraints\footnote{Design Constraints by Anas.}. Namely, it must be the case that all data 
structures concerning the safety controls are as fast as possible but also that they are capable 
of prioritizing all signals in the best way possible.}

    \subsection{Safety}
    \paragraph{} The safety is highly prioritized in our design of the ECS. We have 
    considered associating the fire alarm directly with the ECS because in the case 
    of the fire alarm triggering, this event has a very high priority and the ECS 
    should immediately react to this event. When it comes to elevator and bay safety, 
    each elevator and bay will have set of Safety Controls that they can communicate 
    through and the ECS monitors the situation from the top. By ensuring safety for 
    both bays and the elevators, the ECS operation will be carried smoothly without 
    hurting the passengers.

    \subsection{Implementation Guidelines}
    \paragraph{} According to the design, we suggest programmers to use some sort of 
    Concurrent safe Messaging Queue for the communication between sensing objects and 
    their associated parent objects. We also recommend using concurrent safe Priority 
    Queue for the ECS, so the ECS can react based on the certain given priority. The 
    priority should be considered because in the case of an emergency, the priority 
    for that event should be at the very top so that the ECS should immediately react 
    to it by closing its doors and going to first floor if its not there already.

\section{Definition of Terms} \label{defs}
\paragraph{} \textit{The following is a list of definitions contain the most commonly used 
technical terms within this document, whose meaning may not be immediately apparent to the
