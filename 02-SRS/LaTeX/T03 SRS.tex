\section{Introduction} \label{intro} % Zeke
% project goals and the purpose of this document
	\paragraph{} The purpose of this document is to \textit{specify} the requirements for the
	 development of the Cretaceous Gardens Controller (CGC). The specification is formalized and 
	 diagrammed in order to guide the eventual implementation of the system. Information 
	 encountered in the corresponding \textit{Requirements Definition Document} is reiterated 
	 and restated here where relevant.
	  
	 \paragraph{} After this introduction \footnote{Introduction by Ezequiel Ramos}, 
	 Section \ref{gen} gives an overview of the system. Section \ref{spec} delves into more 
	 detail with subsections \ref{logic} and \ref{inter} that feature a more granular view 
	 of the \textit{Control Logic} and the \textit{External Interfaces}. Section \ref{defs} 
	 provides the definition of technical terms that will be commonly used.

\section{General Description} \label{gen} %Zeke
	\paragraph{}\textit{This section \footnote{General Description by Ezequiel Ramos and 
	Santiago Cejas} provides a general overview of the whole system. How the system interacts with 
	the hardware interfaces and its basic functionality are introduced here. A description of
	parts to be used in the system and the available functionalities for each type are also 
	provided. Some high level constraints and assumptions for the system will be also be presented.
	It should be noted that a more detailed specification of constraints is covered in its 
	own section.}

		\paragraph{}

	\subsection{Assumptions}
	\paragraph{} We assume that the infrastructure is all redundant. The CGC is 
	installed on redundant servers. The network backbone has physical redundant 
	links to appropriate devices like the cameras, the PA speakers, and the 
	electric fence. We will also	program redundancy into the logic. Like the 
	ability to have another car available in case of an emergency or if the car 
	breaks down.
		
	\paragraph{} Another assumption is that messages would be encrypted in order 
	to provide the security needed, so the messages can not be intercepted and 
	modified.

	\subsection{Interfaces} \label{inter}% Anas
	\paragraph{} The Interfaces \footnote{External Interfaces by Anas Gauba} 
	make up all the pieces that the CGC communicates with. The CGC itself must 
	communicate with everything, 	but a lot of interfaces can function on their own. The 
	car interface is an example of one that needs to be able to function on it's own.
